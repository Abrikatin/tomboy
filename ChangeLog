	Thanks to hurricane Jeanne last week, here is a massive commit...

	Thanks to Jon Trowbridge <trow@ximian.com> for the dbus-based
	remote control interface.

	* configure.in: add optional check for dbus, and set ENABLE_DBUS
	if found.  Check for old version (<2.0.5) of GtkSpell, and set
	OLD_GTKSPELL if found.

	* Tomboy/Makefile.am: include RemoteControl.cs and
	RemoteControlProxy.cs if ENABLE_DBUS is set.

	* Tomboy/Note.cs: make SaveDate into ChangeDate, which we update
	whenever the buffer changes.  Fixes ordering in the panel applet
	for notes where the save timeout hasn't been called yet.  Add Uri,
	used by remote control. Add IsOpened, used by the tray menu.  Fix
	newly created notes to remember window position.

	* Tomboy/NoteManager.cs: Use a HIGMessageDialog for showing name
	clash errors.  Add FindByUri, used by the remote control.

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Use a HIGMessageDialog for the delete
	dialog.

	* Tomboy/RecentChanges.cs: Update results on note
	rename/add/delete.

	* Tomboy/Tomboy.cs: Register the remote control with dbus.

	* Tomboy/Tray.cs: Add tooltip to notification icon which says
	"Tomboy Notes" and lists the global shortcut key for showing the
	menu.  Create menu accelerators which map to their global
	shortcuts stored in gconf ("Alt-F11" next to Start Here, by
	default).

	* Tomboy/Utils.cs: Add HIGMessageDialog, which implements the HIG
	recommended message dialog.

	* Tomboy/Watchers.cs: Middle clicking a link/url closes the
	opening note.  Shift or control clicking a link/url places the
	cursor instead of opening.  Control-Enter with cursor on a
	link/url opens it. Use a HIGMessageDialog for location open error
	dialog.  Fix wikiword identification to ignore words with internal
	punctuation, and disregard any trailing punctuation.

	* TrayIcon/libtrayicon/tomboykeybinder.c: Regrab keys if the
	default keymap changes.

	* Tomboy/Search.cs: Make searches implicitly AND words instead of
	OR.  Also fix a bug with spaces at the end of the search string.

2004-09-27  Beno√Æt Dejean  <tazforever@dlfp.org>

	* configure.in: Added "fr" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-27  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	Lots of changes...

	* Add calls to Catalog.GetString everywhere we use a translatable
	string.
	* Add MouseHandWatcher which will change the mouse cursor to a
	hand when hovering over links.
	* Add global keybinding code
	* Add gconf setting to allow opening the notes menu (<Alt>F12 by
	default), opening Start Here (<Alt>F11 by default), creating a new
	note, opening the Search dialog, and opening the Recent Changes
	dialog.
	* Fix session saving, so our wrapper script gets executed by
	gnome-session.
	* Add beginning of bullet list and horizonal spacer code,
	commented out for now.
	
	Added Files...

	* tomboy.desktop.in: .desktop file to make tomboy show up in
	Applications/Accessories.
	* tomboy.schemas.in: Add gconf schema with global keybindings.
	* Tomboy/Defines.cs.in: Gets generated to Defines.cs, so we can
	find our translation files.
	* TrayIcon/libtrayicon/eggaccelerators.[ch]: Handles parsing of
	global gconf keybinding strings.
	* TrayIcon/libtrayicon/tomboykeybinder.[ch]: Listens for global
	keybindings on the X root window.

2004-09-24  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* www/index.html: Add copyright notice for Tintin.

2004-09-23  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/Watchers.cs: Copy the mautilus behavior of "middle click
	closes the opener" when clicking note links.  Should this apply
	for clicking urls as well?

2004-09-21  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/Note.cs: Subscribe to window configure events, and save
	the note on change.  This should fix any problems people are
	having with spatial note windows.

2004-09-21  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/Search.cs: Fixed up things a bit: Make the dialog a
	singleton, so clicking search anywhere will bring up same search
	dialog, and reapply the search to the current note.  Scroll to
	the matched text.  Fix insertion into the search history list
	(sort of, it'll still show partial entries if you type slow).
	Search still needs some work wrt listening for change events and
	optimizing, as well as making the currently iterated note title
	bold in the search dialog.

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Use a property accessor to get the find
	dialog instance everywhere, instead of keeping a local copy.
	* Tomboy/Tray.cs: Ditto.

2004-09-21  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* configure.in: Drop the gtkspell 2.0.6 dependency.  Bump version
	to 0.1.2.
	* tomboy.spec.in (Requires): Ditto.

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Bind find-next and find-previous to the
	right callback, instead of CloseWindowHandler.  Doh.

	* Tomboy/Watchers.cs: Override gtkspell's tag to use the squiggly
	with a black foreground text color.  This makes us not depend on
	the newest gtkspell versions.  Gtk 2.2 versions of pango will just
	show misspellings as black text with a regular underline.

	* Tomboy/Search.cs (OnFindPreviousClicked): Fix bug where previous
	was only jumping between first and last match.

	* www/index.html: Point to 0.1.2 tarball.

2004-09-20  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Allow escape and Ctrl-w to close a note
	for now, until I get some feedback on which to use.

2004-09-20  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 0.1.1.
	* www/index.html: Point to 0.1.1 tarball.

	Add NEWS, AUTHORS, COPYING, README files.

2004-09-20  Alex Graveley  <alex@ximian.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Set the close window key to Escape, which
	makes tomboy feel less obtrusive.  Suggestion from Michael Groﬂe
	<mgrosze@web.de>.

2004-09-20  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: Ask for confirmation before deleting.
	Based on patch from Johan Wallenborg <johan@deepfolks.com>.

2004-09-20  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* tomboy.spec.in: Initial spec file from Ricardo Veguilla
	<veguilla@hpcf.upr.edu>.

	* Tomboy/NoteManager.cs (NoteManager.CreateStartNote): Fix typo.

	* Tomboy/Note.cs: Pass a StreamReader for the note's file to the
	XmlTextReader constructor.  Hopefully it won't complain about
	invalid URLs in some versions of mono.  Reported by O'Grady
	Stephen <sogrady@redmonk.com>.

2004-09-19  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* configure.in: Require gtkspell version 2.0.6.

2004-09-19  Jesse Andrews  <anotherjesse@gmail.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteBuffer.cs: changed internal linnk back to red

2004-09-19  Jesse Andrews  <anotherjesse@gmail.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteBuffer.cs: modified color of internal link to
	dark green since misspellings are red

	* Tomboy/NoteManager.cs: store notes in ~/.tomboy instead of ~/tomboy

2004-09-18  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* TrayIcon/libtrayicon/Makefile.am: Install libtrayicon.so into
	pkglibdir.

	* TrayIcon/Makefile.am: Install TrayIcon.dll into pkglibdir.

	* Tomboy/tomboy.in: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and MONO_PATH.

	* Tomboy/Watchers.cs: Avoid an infinite loop for buffers with no
	content.

2004-09-18  Alex Graveley  <alex@beatniksoftware.com>

	* Tomboy/NoteWindow.cs: 
	* Tomboy/RecentChanges.cs: 
	* Tomboy/Search.cs: Gtk.ScrolledWindow.Child is read-only on Gtk#
	HEAD, use Add() instead.

	* configure.in: PKG_CHECK for gtkspell-2.0, since we call into it
	from C#.
