      <div id="intro">
        <img src="./img/intro.gif" alt="Tintin rocks" />
      </div>

      <p>Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix.
      Simple and easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas
      and information you deal with every day.</p>

      <p>Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a
      website you wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting,
      or remember an idea about the direction of the political landscape in
      post-industrial Australia?  Or are you one of those desperate souls with
      home-made, buggy, or not-quite-perfect notes systems?</p>

      <!-- We've all been there, stuck using archaic applications, trying to
      make a script work the way we want, or forced to stick to a file naming
      regiment just to remember where to look for information. -->

      <p>Time for Tomboy.  We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little
      application can make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.</p>

      <h2>Keeping Track</h2>

      <div id="windows">

          <img src="./img/windows-small.png" alt="Linking between notes" />
	</div>
	Linking between notes.
      </div>

      <p>The key to Tomboy's usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes and
      ideas together.  Using a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb">
      WikiWiki</a>-like linking system, organizing ideas is as simple as typing
      a name.  Branching an idea off is easy as pressing the <b>Link</b> button.
      And links between your ideas won't break, even when renaming and
      reorganizing them.</p>

      <div id="applet">
        <div>
          <img src="./img/applet-small.png" alt="Panel applet in action" />
	</div>
	Always there for the grabbing.
      </div>

      <h2>Accessing your notes</h2>

      <p>Accessing your notes is usually a quick mouse-flick away.  Just click
      on the Tomboy Panel applet, which is always visible on your desktop.  You
      can choose one of the notes you've recently viewed from the menu or
      <b>Search</b> for older notes.  <b>Recent Changes</b> lists all your notes
      in the order they were last modified.</p>

      <p>No more moving your applications to find a website you dragged to the
      desktop.  No more searching your filesystem to find where you think you
      maybe put last week's TODO list.</p>

      <h2>Friendly Editing</h2>

      <p>Tomboy supports many advanced editing features, but they won't bother
      you until you need them.  Stream-lining the interface as much as possible
      to avoid distractions is a key goal of ours.  <i>Because software should
      never slow your momentum!</i></p>

      <p>Some of the editing features supported:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Highlighting text</li>
        <li>Inline spell checking</li>
	<li>Auto-linking web &amp; email addresses</li>
	<li>Undo/redo</li>
	<li>Font styling &amp; sizing</li>
	<li>Bulleted &amp; numbered lists <i>(under development)</i></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Embracing Your Habitat</h2>

      <p>It is a top priority for Tomboy to be able to handle all the sorts of
      information you want to keep track of.  We are currently developing
      support for linking-to and managing all the <b>Desktop Objects</b> you
      interact with, all from within a simple note interface.

      <p>Support is currently in the works for:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Creating <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/evolution/">
	  Evolution</a> Todo and Task items
	</li>
	<li>Linking to and annotating scheduled Appointments</li>
	<li>Linking to received Emails</li>
	<li>Online status of instant messaging Buddies</li>
	<li>Inline File &amp; Image previews</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org/">Rhythmbox</a> Playlists</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stay tuned here for more information about this exciting new way to
      organize and relate all of your stuff.</p>
