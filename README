Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix. Simple and easy
to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and information you
deal with every day.

Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a website you
wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting, or remember an idea
about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial Australia? Or
are you one of those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or not-quite-perfect
notes systems?

Time for Tomboy. We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application can
make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.
